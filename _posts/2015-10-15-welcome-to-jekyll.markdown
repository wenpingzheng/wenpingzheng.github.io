>Dealing with the Weather

* What is the weather like outside?

* Well, when I went out for lunch it was `raining`. I had a problem beacause I did not bring an umbrella.

* `I do not like` the `rain`, but `I don't mind` the `snow`, It rarely snows around here.

* I agree. We have not had much snow this `Winter`. I prefer the `Fall`. When the tree leaves are full of color and the air is cool.How is <b class="error">the</b> weather in your country?

* I am from `Brazil`,where it is `warm` most of the year.<b class="error">Summer</b> is my favorite season. I love <b class="error">the</b> hot weather and being able to go to the beach.

* Sounds nice! Do you know what the weather is going to be over the weekend?

* Well, it's <b class="error">supposed</b> to be `sunny` tomorrow. but `cloudy` on `Thursday`. I don't know about the weekend.
