>Dealing with the Weather

* What is the weather like outside?

* Well, when I went out for lunch it was `raining`. I had a problem beacause I did not bring an umbrella.

* `I do not like` the `rain`, but `I don't mind` the `snow`, It rarely snows around here.

* I agree. We have not had much snow this `Winter`. I prefer the `Fall`. When the tree leaves are full of color and the air is cool.How is <b class="error">the</b> weather in your country?

* I am from `Brazil`,where it is `warm` most of the year.<b class="error">Summer</b> is my favorite season. I love <b class="error">the</b> hot weather and being able to go to the beach.

* Sounds nice! Do you know what the weather is going to be over the weekend?

* Well, it's <b class="error">supposed</b> to be `sunny` tomorrow. but `cloudy` on `Thursday`. I don't know about the weekend.


>Planning to Meet

* Do you have any plans for tonight?

* Yes. I was planning <b class="error">on going</b> to `see a movie`, and then <b class="error">going</b> `to  a nightclub`. Would you like to join me?

* That sounds like fun!

* Where can we meet?

* We can meet at my `hotel`.

* At what time?  

* Well, the movie <b class="error">starts</b> at `seven` pm. so we should leave by `six` thirty.

* Ok, I can pick you up. Can you give me the address?

* It is at `one-hundreed` <b class="error">Washington</b> Street.

* <b class="error">Okay</b>, I can give you a call when I get there. What is your phone number?

* It is 213-555-8476

* <b class="error">Great</b>! I will see you there.  


> Describe Your Daily Schedule

* I `always` get up around 6am, so I can do my <b class="error">workout</b> and get the children ready for school. Then, I come to work, and drive back home around 7pm. what about you?

* I `usualy` wake up early as well, I need to catch the first train to come to work. But today I overslept and had to get a car. At night, I like to go for a walk before dinner. <b class="error">Some days</b>, I go meet some friends for a drink right after work. Today, I will <b class="error">probably</b> work late to finish that project.

* Hmm. I `almost nerver` go out for a drink, At night ,I `usualy` cook dinner, and watch some TV , but tonight, my husband and I are going to go to <b class="error">a</b> concert.

* That sounds fun! Have a good time.

* Thanks!
