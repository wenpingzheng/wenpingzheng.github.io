>Dealing with the Weather

* What is the weather like outside?

* I went out for lunch it was `raining`, I had a problem beacause I did not bring an unbrella.

* `I don't like` the rain, but I don't mind the `snow`, it's rarely snows around here.

* I agree, we have not had much snow this `winter`. I prefer the `fall`, When the tree leaves are full of color and the air is cool.How is weather in your country?

* I am from `brazial`.Where it's warm most of the year.Summary is my favorite season.I love hot weather and being able to go to the beach.

* Sounds nice.Do you know what the weather is going to be over the weekend.

* Well, it's suppose to be sunny tomorrow. but `cloudy` on `thursday`. but I don't know about the weekend.
